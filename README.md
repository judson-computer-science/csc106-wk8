# Week 8

## Exercise 1
Based on the knowledge that `values()` exists, create class that iterates over the values in an Enum and prints all variations for each.

## Exercise 2
One common thing that you might want to do is get the Enum instance based on some value.  For example, we might want to get the Enum instances based on the name of a variation.  Break into pairs and derive an implementation of `fromVariation()` that does this using the provided implementation of the `Color` enum as a starting point.  The method should belong to the `Color` enum.

Your goal is to make the existing implementation of the `ColorTest` class work.
